    <h2>Topic Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Obesity is a major health metric linked to chronic illness.</li>
      <li>We are leveraging data to understand how physical and lifestyle factors predict obesity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Enables personalized health recommendations.</li>
      <li>Promotes early intervention for obesity-related conditions.</li>

  <h2>Data Description</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis uses the
    <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition" target="_blank">
      “Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition”
    </a>
    from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository. The dataset includes synthetic and real data collected from individuals, capturing various lifestyle and health-related behaviors.
  </p>
  <p>
    It contains <strong>2111 records</strong> and <strong>17 attributes</strong>. The target variable, <code>NObeyesdad</code>, categorizes obesity levels into 7 classes:
    Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III.
  </p>
  <p>
    The remaining 16 features represent demographic (e.g., age, gender), anthropometric (height, weight), and lifestyle attributes such as physical activity frequency, food intake habits, water consumption, and time spent on electronic devices.
  </p>

  <h2>Interactive Features Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Several of the visualizations in this analysis are <strong>interactive</strong>, allowing you to explore patterns in the data beyond what a static chart can show.
    These interactive elements make it easier to spot trends, filter by categories, and drill down into specific subgroups.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Scatter Plot (Section 3):</strong> You can <em>brush-select</em> groups of individuals based on their physical activity and see how transportation method distributions change in real-time.</li>
    <li><strong>Bar Charts (Sections 2 and 5):</strong> Use <em>dropdown filters</em> to explore how obesity levels vary across gender, age, and transportation type.</li>
    <li><strong>Correlation Heatmap (Section 1):</strong> <em>Hover</em> over each cell to explore precise correlation values, and use the <em>dropdown menu</em> to see how each feature correlates with others in ranked order.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These interactive features are not just visual enhancements — they offer powerful ways to uncover relationships, test assumptions, and identify at-risk groups within the dataset.

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Data analysis indicates that lower levels of physical activity and higher electronic device usage may be associated with higher obesity levels.</li>
    <li>Unhealthy dietary choices and a sedentary lifestyle might contribute to obesity in some cases.</li>
    <li>Observations on different transportation methods suggest that more active commuting could be linked to lower obesity prevalence.</li>
    <li>The interplay between gender, age, and dietary behaviors suggests that tailored intervention strategies might be beneficial.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>



  <div class="section">
  <h2>Future Work</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Investigate the impact of dietary habits, including the frequency of high-calorie food consumption, frequency of vegetable intake, and the number of main meals, on obesity trends in greater detail.</li>
    <li>Develop predictive models for early obesity risk detection using lifestyle variables such as physical activity level and electronic device usage.</li>
    <li>Expand the dataset to include a broader demographic range and additional social determinants of health.</li>
    <li>Examine the roles of family history and gender differences to design personalized intervention programs.</li>
  </ul>
