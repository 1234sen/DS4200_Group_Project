    <h1>Obesity Level Data Visualization Analysis</h1>
    <p><strong>Project Introduction</strong>: This project aims to analyze the relationship between obesity levels and factors such as gender, age, physical activity level, and transportation methods through data visualization. Tasks include creating heatmaps to show variable correlations, interactive bar charts to analyze obesity distribution, interactive scatter plots to explore the relationship between physical activity and obesity, and other charts to provide supplementary insights.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Description</strong>: The dataset contains 4 records (expandable), sourced from public obesity research data, with 17 attributes: Gender, Age, Height, Weight, family_history_with_overweight, FAVC (high-calorie food frequency), FCVC (vegetable intake frequency), NCP (main meal count), CAEC (food intake between meals), SMOKE, CH2O (water intake), SCC (calorie monitoring), FAF (physical activity level), TUE (electronic device usage time), CALC (alcohol consumption frequency), MTRANS (transportation method), NObeyesdad (obesity level).</p>

    <h2>1. Variable Correlation Heatmap</h2>
    <p><strong>Key Points</strong>: The heatmap shows correlations between numerical variables, for example, weight has a strong positive correlation with obesity level. Interactive features allow users to hover to view specific values.</p>

    <h2>2. Interactive Obesity Level Distribution Bar Chart</h2>
    <p><strong>Key Points</strong>: The bar chart shows the population distribution of obesity levels. Users can filter data by gender or age group through dropdown menus to discover obesity patterns in specific groups.</p>

    <h2>3. Physical Activity Level vs Obesity Level Interactive Scatter Plot</h2>
    <p><strong>Key Points</strong>: The scatter plot shows the relationship between physical activity level (FAF) and obesity level. Hovering displays individual details, and filtering features reveal the influence of gender and transportation methods.</p>

    <h2>4. Age vs Obesity Level Box Plot</h2>
    <p><strong>Key Points</strong>: The box plot shows the age distribution across different obesity levels, revealing that obesity may be related to age groups.</p>

    <h2>5. Transportation Method vs Obesity Level Stacked Bar Chart</h2>
    <p><strong>Key Points</strong>: The stacked bar chart shows the association between transportation methods and obesity levels, suggesting that walking may be associated with lower obesity levels.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p><strong>Findings</strong>: 1) Weight and obesity level are highly correlated, and family history of overweight may also be a risk factor; 2) Individuals with higher physical activity levels tend to have lower obesity levels; 3) Transportation methods may affect obesity, with walkers having lower obesity rates.<br>
       <strong>Future Work</strong>: Increase sample size, analyze interaction effects between eating habits and obesity, and explore time-series data to observe obesity trends.</p>
